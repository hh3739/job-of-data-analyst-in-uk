<div>
  
<p>This project provides a way of using requests and lxml to automaticlly crawl data of analyst jobs from the reed.c.uk. Its include job title, salary, location, job type, and job descrpition. 
Second steps of data cleaning is done by Pthon is to trim off blank spaces, puncation marks, and cut sentences into words and get rid of stop words

<div><p>The analysis is built on five dimensions which are salary, job type , location ,job posted date and job descriptions. The range of salary are widly spread between £100 to £600 per day, the level of salaries is depended on job type and location, London Cambridge Essex are the three top paid places, and contractors seems get the higest daily paid. On the other hand, perment jobs are posted more than contract and temporary ones,compare to December, more perment jobs vacancies available in November.

Key skills are extracted from job descriptions are SQL and business skill,reporting, Excel and power BI. And I am shocking that python is not one of the key skills. However, the crucial requirements of each data analyst job are found very different in terms of different industries.

Technic I used for text analysis can even be extended into advance level, such as combine tfidf with k-mean++ to infer out job responsibility and job requirements separately
